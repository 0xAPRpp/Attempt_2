/*Exercise 5-5. Write a program equivalent to that of Exercise 5-4, except for the
following:
If before you used a for loop to count the characters, you now use while, or vice versa.
This time you should first reverse the characters in the array, before printing them
out left to right (for the sake of the exercise you could still use a loop to print out the
characters one by one).*/
