/*Exercise 6-3. Write a program that reads an array size from the keyboard and
dynamically allocates an array of that size to hold floating-point values. Using pointer
notation, initialize all the elements of the array so that the value of the element at
index position n is 1 / (n + 1)2. Calculate the sum of the elements using array notation,
multiply the sum by 6, and output the square root of that result.*/
