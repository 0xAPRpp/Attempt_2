/*Exercise 5-8. The famous Fibonacci series is a sequence of integers with the first
two values as 1 and the subsequent values as the sum of the two preceding values.
So, it begins 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. This is not just a mathematical curiosity.
The sequence also regularly appears in biological settings, for instance. It relates to
the way shells grow in a spiral, and the number of petals on many flowers is a number
from this sequence. Create an array<> container with 93 elements. Store the first 93
numbers in the Fibonacci series in the array and then output them one per line.
Any idea why weâ€™d be asking you to generate 93 Fibonacci numbers and not, say, 100?*/
