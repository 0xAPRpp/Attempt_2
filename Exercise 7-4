/*Exercise 7-4. Write a program that prompts for the input of two words and determines
whether one is an anagram of the other. An anagram of a word is formed by
rearranging its letters, using each of the original letters precisely once. For instance,
listen and silent are anagrams of one another, but listens and silent are not.*/
