/*Exercise 2-2. Using your solution for Exercise 2-1, improve the code so that the user
can control the precision of the output by entering the number of digits required. To
really show off how accurate floating-point numbers can be, you can perhaps switch
to double-precision floating-point arithmetic as well. You’ll need a more precise
approximation of π. 3.141592653589793238 will do fine.*/

const long double value_of_pi{ 3.141592653589793238 }; //Global Variable for global constant
//also allows use of name instead of value

int main()

	long double radius{};

	unsigned int precision{}; //Unsigned since the value cannot be negative
