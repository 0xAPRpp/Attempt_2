/*Exercise 4-5. Add some code at the end of the main() function of Ex4_06.cpp to
print an additional message. If you have exactly one mouse, output a message of the
form “It is a brown/white mouse.” Otherwise, if you have multiple mice, compose a
grammatically correct message of the form “Of these mice, N is a/are brown mouse/
mice.” If you have no mice, no new message needs to be printed. Use an appropriate
mixture of conditional operators and if/else statements.*/
