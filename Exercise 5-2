/*Exercise 5-2. Write a program that uses a while loop to accumulate the sum of an
arbitrary number of integers entered by the user. After every iteration, ask the user
whether he or she is done entering numbers. The program should output the total of all
the values and the overall average as a floating-point value.*/
