/*Exercise 7-8. Repeat Exercise 7-7, only this time the user inputs the numbers one by
one, each time followed by an enter. The input should be gathered as a sequence of
distinct strings—for the sake of the exercise still not directly as integers—which are
then concatenated to a single string. The input is still terminated by a # character. Also,
this time, you’re not allowed to use a string stream anymore to extract the numbers
from the resulting string.*/
