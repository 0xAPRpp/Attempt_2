/*Exercise 3-2. Write a program to calculate how many square boxes can be contained
in a single layer on a rectangular shelf, with no overhang. The dimensions of the shelf
in feet and the dimension of a side of the box in inches are read from the keyboard.
Use variables of type double for the length and depth of the shelf and type int for the
length of the side of a box. Define and initialize an integer constant to convert from feet
to inches (1 foot equals 12 inches). Calculate the number of boxes that the shelf can
hold in a single layer of type long and output the result.*/

# include <iostream>
# include <iomanip>

const int inches_in_ft{ 12 };

int main()
{
	double length_in_ft{ }, depth_in_ft{  }; //dimension in feet for rectangle shelf
	int side_length_in_inches{}; //dimension in inches for side length of the box

	long count{}; // for the no of boxes after calculation

	std::cin >> length_in_ft >> depth_in_ft >> side_length_in_inches;

	count = (((length_in_ft * inches_in_ft)/side_length_in_inches) * ((depth_in_ft * inches_in_ft) / side_length_in_inches));
	std::cout << count << std::endl;

	system("pause");
